## The idea of this project :

V2 of the same Robo-Rolodex project I have created is the same UI and behavior but with different 
functionality 

`Rending in React is extremely important to understand`
`React will read the contructor class before rendering `
`React then will render`
`After rendering React will go through the DidMount` 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### To download the repository:
### `Github URL`
### `Run Git clone 'URL' that you copied`
### `Run npm start`
