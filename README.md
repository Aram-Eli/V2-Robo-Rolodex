## The idea of this project :

V2 of the same Robo-Rolodex project I have created is the same UI and behavior but with different 
functionality as i converted the class components to functional components

if you are on your way to learn the difference between functional components and class components
this good project will help you alot to understand better as the documentation assuming you already 
understand all these concepts...

`Rending in React is extremely important to understand`
`React will read the contructor class before rendering `
`React then will render`
`After rendering React will go through the DidMount` 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### To download the repository:
 `Github URL`

 `Run npm start`
